# House-Price-Prediction-Competition
Kaggles Advanced house price prediction competition

In this competition We have used machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machine,  Extra Gradient Boosting, Random Forest.

<h2>Important Key Steps:</h2>

<h3> -> Exploratory Data Analysis.<br>
-> Tested assumptions of regression.<br>
-> PreProcessing Data.<br>
-> Model Building.<br>
-> HyperParameter Tunning.<br>
-> Saving Results as dataframe. <br></h3>


House Price Prediction Competition held by Kaggle
•ML algorithms used: Support vector machine, Random forest regressor, Extreme gradient Boosting.
•Statistical Techniques : Distribution of features, Outliers detection using boxplot, Nominal data transformation, Ordinal data transformation, Transformation of distributions,
• EDA: Data visualization using histograms, scatterplots, boxplots. Data preprocessing, imputation of missing values, correaltion matrix, Dealing with categorical features using appropriate encoding.
• Association between two categorical variables using chi-square test for attributes.
• Feature engineering: Creating new features, computing variance inflation factor(VIF) to check multicollinearity. Tried using Principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction in presence of multicollinearity (didnt improved results so not mentioned in project)
• Standardized numerical features using Robust Scaler
• k_fold cross validation to validate the model
•GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tunning of various trained model
